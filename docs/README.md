## Documentation Types

### 1. Daily Development Logs (`/development/daily_logs/`)
- **Purpose**: Track daily progress, decisions, and technical details
- **Naming Convention**: `YYYY_MM_DD.md` (e.g., `2024_05_28.md`)
- **Content Structure**:
  - Morning/Afternoon sessions
  - Completed tasks
  - Technical details
  - Issues and decisions
  - Next steps

### 2. Integration Log (`/development/integration_log.md`)
- **Purpose**: Document integration processes and decisions
- **When to Update**: Any time I integrate new components or make significant changes

### 3. Project Analysis (`/development/project_analysis.md`)
- **Purpose**: High-level project analysis and architectural decisions
- **When to Update**: Major project decisions or architectural changes

### 4. Project Timeline (`/development/project_timeline.md`)
- **Purpose**: Track project milestones and deadlines
- **When to Update**: When planning new phases or updating project progress

## Best Practices
1. **One Log Per Day**: Keep all daily activities in a single daily log file
2. **Consistent Naming**: Follow the established naming conventions
3. **Regular Updates**: Update documentation as I work, not after
4. **Cross-References**: Link between related documents when relevant
5. **Check First**: Before creating new documentation, check if it belongs in an existing document

## Getting Started
1. Check `TODO.md` in the root directory for current tasks
2. Review the latest daily log in `/development/daily_logs/`
3. Consult relevant technical documentation for specific components

## Need Help?
If unsure where to document something:
1. Check this overview first
2. If it's daily work -> use daily logs
3. If it's a major decision -> update project analysis
4. If it's integration related -> use integration log
