   ```
   kyc_requirements.md
          ↓
   validation_rules.md
          ↓
   customer_data_analysis.md
          ↓
   data_relationships.md
   ```

2. Analysis Chain:
   ```
   missing_country_analysis.md → validation_rules.md
                                      ↓
   customer_data_analysis.md  ←→ data_relationships.md
   ```

## Best Practices
1. **Daily Updates**:
   - Update daily logs as you work
   - Include document status changes
   - Cross-reference related documents

2. **Status Indicators**:
   - ✓ COMPLETED: Analysis/implementation done
   - 🔄 IN PROGRESS: Currently being worked on
   - ⏳ PENDING: Waiting to be started

3. **Cross-References**:
   - All documents are cross-linked using relative paths
   - Document relationships are clearly defined
   - Each analysis links to related documents

## Getting Started
