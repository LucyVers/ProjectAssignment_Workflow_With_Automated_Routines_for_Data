# Analysis of Transactions with Missing Country Data

## Overview
This document focuses on analyzing the 500 transactions where the sender_country field is empty. This analysis is crucial for:
1. Understanding the nature of these missing values
2. Identifying any patterns that might explain the missing data
3. Proposing potential solutions for handling these cases

## Analysis Steps

### Step 1: Extract Transactions with Missing Countries
First, I will identify and analyze these specific transactions to understand their characteristics:
- Transaction timing
- Amount patterns
- Other geographical data (municipalities)
- Transaction types
- Any common patterns in sender or receiver accounts

### Step 2: Initial Query Results
Sample of transactions with missing sender countries:
```
transaction_id: 0308a664-8b78-40bd-9281-8623b3d2584a
- Amount: 10,977.56 SEK
- From: Uddevalla (no country) to Skövde, Sweden
- Type: outgoing
- Purpose: Rent transfer

transaction_id: 32b8ef63-4f95-4891-a39a-8b67a2ca57d9
- Amount: 30,955.77 SEK
- From: Örnsköldsvik (no country) to Gävle, Sweden
- Type: incoming
- Purpose: Freelance project payment

transaction_id: ccd9d591-1e7e-4924-9565-406698971238
- Amount: 15,551.69 SEK
- From: Östersund (no country) to Sandviken, Sweden
- Type: outgoing
- Purpose: [empty]

[Additional examples omitted for brevity]
```

## Initial Findings
1. Pattern in Missing Data:
   - All receiver_country fields are "Sweden"
   - All sender municipalities are Swedish cities
   - This suggests these are domestic transactions where sender_country should be "Sweden"

2. Transaction Characteristics:
   - Mix of incoming and outgoing transactions
   - Various amount ranges (10,000 - 33,000 SEK in samples)
   - Valid Swedish municipalities in sender_municipality
   - All transactions use SEK currency
   - Most have valid purpose descriptions (with one exception)

3. Data Quality Implications:
   - This appears to be a systematic issue with domestic transactions
   - The missing country field might be due to:
     a) Assumption that domestic transactions don't need sender_country
     b) Data entry/import process issue for domestic transactions
     c) Possible software bug in transaction recording system

## Next Steps
1. Verify Pattern:
   - Check if ALL 500 transactions follow same pattern (Swedish municipalities, SEK currency)
   - Analyze full amount distribution
   - Check for any exceptions to the pattern

2. Data Validation:
   - Create validation rule to auto-fill "Sweden" when:
     a) Currency is SEK
     b) Sender municipality is a valid Swedish city
     c) Receiver country is Sweden

3. Root Cause Investigation:
   - Review transaction creation process
   - Check if pattern occurs in specific time periods
   - Investigate any system changes that might have caused this

4. Recommendations (Preliminary):
   - Add data validation to ensure country field is never empty
   - Auto-populate "Sweden" for domestic transactions
   - Add logging to track when/why country field is left empty

## Next Analysis Query
```sql
Command to be executed:
tail -n +2 transactions.csv | awk -F',' '$7==""' | awk -F',' '{print $3}' | sort -n | uniq -c
```
This will show us the distribution of transaction amounts for all transactions with missing countries.

## Patterns and Correlations

### Amount Distribution Analysis
1. Transaction Amount Range:
   - Lowest amount: 64.63
   - Highest amount: 49,716.10
   - Wide range of amounts suggests these are various types of transactions

2. Currency Distribution (Unexpected Finding):
   - SEK: 405 transactions (81%)
   - USD: 73 transactions (14.6%)
   - DKK: 9 transactions (1.8%)
   - EUR: 6 transactions (1.2%)
   - NOK: 5 transactions (1%)
   - JPY: 1 transaction (0.2%)
   - ZMW: 1 transaction (0.2%)

### Key Insights
1. Currency Diversity:
   - My initial assumption about all transactions being in SEK was incorrect
   - Multiple currencies involved suggests these aren't all domestic transactions
   - Need to revise my earlier hypothesis about these being purely domestic transactions

2. Pattern Revision:
   - The presence of multiple currencies indicates this is a more complex issue than I initially thought
   - Cannot simply assume all missing country fields should be "Sweden"
   - Need to investigate why international transactions (indicated by foreign currencies) are missing country data

3. Risk Assessment:
   - Higher risk than initially evaluated
   - Missing country data in international transactions could affect:
     - Regulatory compliance
     - Anti-money laundering (AML) checks
     - Transaction fee calculations
     - Financial reporting

## Updated Recommendations
1. Immediate Actions:
   - Flag all non-SEK transactions with missing countries for manual review
   - Prioritize fixing transactions with foreign currencies
   - Create separate handling rules for domestic (SEK) vs international transactions

2. Data Validation Rules:
   - Cannot automatically set country to "Sweden" based on currency
   - Need more sophisticated validation rules considering:
     - Currency type
     - Municipality validity
     - Account number format (IBAN country code)

3. System Improvements:
   - Make country field mandatory in transaction system
   - Add currency-based validation rules
   - Implement stronger data quality checks at entry point

## Next Analysis Steps
1. Investigate sender municipalities for non-SEK transactions
2. Check if there's a correlation between transaction amounts and missing country data
3. Analyze transaction types (incoming/outgoing) distribution
4. Review timestamp patterns to identify if this is a time-related issue

### Municipality and Currency Analysis
1. Swedish Municipalities (SEK transactions):
   - Clear pattern of valid Swedish city names
   - Top municipalities:
     * Karlstad (22 transactions)
     * Karlskoga (14 transactions)
     * Kalmar (14 transactions)
     * Multiple cities with 10-12 transactions each
   - All appear to be legitimate Swedish municipalities

2. International Locations:
   - Diverse mix of international place names
   - Notable patterns:
     * Multiple locations with "New", "East", "West", "Port" prefixes (appear to be foreign/fictional)
     * Some authentic international locations (e.g., Burgdorf, Lieto, Tohmajärvi)
     * Some non-Latin script locations (Arabic and Japanese characters present)
     * Several Polish cities (Świętochłowice, Suwałki, Mława)
     * Multiple Danish locations (Storvorde, Stenløse, Nykøbing M)

3. Critical Findings:
   - Clear distinction between domestic and international transaction patterns
   - Swedish transactions: Use real, verifiable municipality names
   - International transactions: Mix of:
     * Real international cities
     * Possibly fictional or incorrectly formatted locations
     * Non-standardized character encodings
   - 3 records with completely empty municipality field (marked as " SEK")

## Updated Risk Assessment
1. Data Quality Issues:
   - Domestic (SEK) transactions appear more reliable
   - International transactions show significant data quality problems:
     * Possible data entry issues
     * Character encoding problems
     * Potential fictional or incorrect location names
     * Inconsistent naming conventions

2. Compliance Risks:
   - International transactions with unclear origins
   - Non-standardized location formats
   - Missing or potentially incorrect geographical data
   - Character encoding issues affecting data integrity

## Revised Recommendations
1. Immediate Actions:
   - Separate handling for domestic vs international transactions
   - Priority review of:
     * All non-Latin script locations
     * Locations with "New", "East", "West", "Port" prefixes
     * Empty municipality records
     * Transactions with non-SEK currency

2. Data Validation Improvements:
   - Implement municipality validation against official Swedish municipality list
   - Add character encoding validation
   - Create standardized format for international location names
   - Require both city and country for international transactions

3. System Enhancements:
   - Add dropdown/autocomplete for Swedish municipalities
   - Implement international location verification
   - Add character encoding standardization
   - Create audit trail for location data changes

## Next Analysis Steps
```sql
Next query to execute:
tail -n +2 transactions.csv | awk -F',' '$7==""' | awk -F',' '{print $2,$4,$8}' | sort | uniq -c
```
This will help us analyze if there are any temporal patterns in these transactions and if the location/currency issues are clustered in specific time periods.

### Revised Temporal Analysis
1. Time Range Distribution (Total 500 transactions):
   - 2022: 4 transactions (all SEK)
   - 2023: 4 transactions (3 SEK, 1 USD)
   - 2025 (Jan-Jul): 489 transactions
   - 2026: 3 transactions (all SEK)

2. Detailed 2025 Monthly Breakdown:
   - January: 119 transactions
     * 99 SEK
     * 18 USD
     * 2 DKK
   - February: 104 transactions
     * 83 SEK
     * 16 USD
     * 3 NOK
     * 1 EUR
     * 1 ZMW
   - March: 93 transactions
     * 82 SEK
     * 9 USD
     * 1 EUR
     * 1 JPY
   - April: 105 transactions
     * 75 SEK
     * 21 USD
     * 5 DKK
     * 2 EUR
     * 2 NOK
   - May: 64 transactions
     * 53 SEK
     * 7 USD
     * 2 DKK
     * 2 EUR
   - June-July: 4 transactions

3. Key Pattern Corrections:
   - Previous assumption about "regular patterns" in Swedish transactions was incorrect
   - Instead, we see:
     * Clear concentration in Jan-May 2025 (485 transactions, 97% of total)
     * Consistent mix of SEK and foreign currencies throughout this period
     * SEK transactions make up 75-85% of each month's volume
     * Foreign currency transactions occur regularly, not sporadically

4. Notable Insights:
   - The issue is highly concentrated in a 5-month period
   - Both domestic and international transactions show similar temporal patterns
   - The ratio between SEK and foreign currencies remains relatively stable
   - Very few transactions outside the main period (11 total across 2022, 2023, and 2026)

## Updated Risk Assessment
1. Temporal Characteristics:
   - Issue is primarily confined to early 2025
   - Affects both domestic and international transactions proportionally
   - Likely related to a specific system change or event in late 2024/early 2025

2. Pattern-based Findings:
   - Consistent ratio of domestic to international transactions suggests a systematic issue
   - The problem affects all transaction types similarly
   - The concentration in early 2025 points to a specific trigger event

## Revised Recommendations
1. Investigation Focus:
   - Examine system changes implemented around December 2024/January 2025
   - Review data validation rules that were in place during this period
   - Investigate why the issue largely resolved after May 2025

2. Data Quality Improvements:
   - Implement monitoring for sudden increases in missing country data
   - Add validation rules that flag unusual patterns in real-time
   - Create automated alerts for missing geographical data

## Next Analysis Steps
```sql
Next query to execute:
tail -n +2 transactions.csv | awk -F',' '$7==""' | awk -F',' '{print $10,$11}' | sort | uniq -c
```
This will help us understand if there's a correlation between transaction types (incoming/outgoing) and their purposes for transactions with missing country data.

## New Analysis: Year 2024 Anomaly
During our year-by-year analysis, I discovered an important pattern:

### Error Rate by Year
- 2022: 4/279 = 1.43% error rate
- 2023: 4/599 = 0.67% error rate
- 2024: 0/129 = 0% error rate (Perfect data quality)
- 2025: 489/98811 = 0.49% error rate
- 2026: 3/192 = 1.56% error rate

### Key Findings from 2024
1. Zero Missing Countries:
   - 2024 is the only year with perfect data quality
   - All transactions have complete country information
   - All transactions follow consistent formatting

2. 2024 Transaction Characteristics:
   - Complete geographical information
   - Consistent city and country pairs
   - Proper formatting of all fields
   - Strong data validation apparent

3. Implications:
   - The problem is NOT year-specific as previously thought
   - 2024's perfect record suggests improved validation was implemented
   - Error rates in other years (0.49-1.56%) suggest consistent underlying issues
   - The high number of 2025 errors is proportional to transaction volume

### Updated Analysis Direction
1. Investigation Priority:
   - Study 2024's transaction processing system
   - Identify what validation rules were in place
   - Understand why these validations weren't applied in other years

2. Solution Approach:
   - Use 2024 as the "gold standard" for data quality
   - Analyze differences in transaction processing between 2024 and other years
   - Consider backporting 2024's validation rules to the entire system

This discovery significantly changes my understanding of the problem. Rather than focusing solely on correcting existing errors, I should investigate how 2024 achieved perfect data quality and replicate those conditions across all years.
