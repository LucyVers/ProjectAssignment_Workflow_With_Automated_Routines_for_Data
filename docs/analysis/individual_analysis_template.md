### 2.4 Scalability and Performance Optimization
- **Challenge**: Handling of Large Data Processing
  * Need to process 1 million transactions per day
  * Risk of memory overload with large data sets
  * Potential bottlenecks in database connections
  * Need for efficient resource utilization

- **Implemented Solutions**:
  1. **Batch-Processing**
     * Implemented chunk-based data processing
     * Configurable batch size (standard: 500 records)
     * Advantages:
       - Minimizes memory usage
       - Allows parallel processing
       - Easier error handling and recovery
     * Implementation in workflow.py:
       ```python
       def process_batch(df: pd.DataFrame, batch_size: int):
           for start_idx in range(0, len(df), batch_size):
               batch = df.iloc[start_idx:start_idx + batch_size]
       ```

  2. **Connection Pooling**
     * Implemented QueuePool from SQLAlchemy
     * Optimized configuration:
       - pool_size: 5 (base connections)
       - max_overflow: 10 (extra when high load)
       - pool_timeout: 30 seconds
       - pool_recycle: 30 minutes
     * Advantages:
       - Efficient reuse of connections
       - Automatic handling of broken connections
       - Improved scalability at high load

  3. **Retry Mechanisms**
     * Implemented automatic retries for database operations
     * Exponential backoff strategy
     * Advantages:
       - Increased system resilience against transient failures
       - Automatic recovery
       - Reduced need for manual intervention

- **Result and Performance Benefits**:
  * Successful handling of 1M+ transactions
  * Stable memory usage even under high load
  * Improved error tolerance and system stability
  * Efficient resource utilization

- **Comparison with Alternative Solutions**:
  1. **Batch vs. Streaming**
     * Batch-processing chosen for:
       - Easier implementation
       - Better error handling
       - Easier to restart if needed
     * Streaming could have:
       - Real-time processing
       - Lower latency
       * But would require:
         - More complex infrastructure
         - Harder error handling
         - Higher operational costs

  2. **Connection Pooling vs. Single Connections**
     * Connection pooling gives:
       - Better resource utilization
       - Higher throughput
       - Lower overhead
     * Single connections would:
       - Waste system resources
       - Create unnecessary overhead
       - Limit scalability

  3. **Retry Strategy vs. Direct Error Reporting**
     * Our retry strategy:
       - Increases system resilience
       - Reduces manual handling
       - Improves user experience
     * Direct error reporting would:
       - Require more manual monitoring
       - Increase data loss risk
       - Deteriorate system reliability

- **Learning and Best Practices**:
  * Importance of designing for scalability from the start
  * Importance of balancing complexity against need
  * Value of thorough performance testing
  * Advantages of incremental optimization

### 2.5 System Crashes and Recovery - A Practical Experience
- **Incident**: System Crash During Large Data Processing
  * Project crashed during execution
  * Lost working memory and active progress
  * Had to restart from scratch
  * Valuable lesson in the importance of robust systems

- **Identified Issues**:
  1. **Memory Management**
     * Tried to process too much data at once
     * Insufficient memory management
     * No incremental saving of progress
     * Missing recovery points

  2. **Data Loss**
     * Lost partially processed data
     * No logging of progress
     * Hard to know where the process stopped
     * Time-consuming to restart from scratch

- **Implemented Improvements**:
  1. **Robust Batch-Processing**
     * Implemented checkpointing after each batch
     * Saves progress continuously
     * Example implementation:
       ```python
       def process_with_checkpoints(data: pd.DataFrame, batch_size: int = 500):
           checkpoint_file = "checkpoint.json"
           
           # Read last checkpoint if it exists
           last_processed = 0
           if os.path.exists(checkpoint_file):
               with open(checkpoint_file, 'r') as f:
                   last_processed = json.load(f)['last_processed']
           
           # Continue from last checkpoint
           for start_idx in range(last_processed, len(data), batch_size):
               batch = data.iloc[start_idx:start_idx + batch_size]
               process_batch(batch)
               
               # Save checkpoint after each batch
               with open(checkpoint_file, 'w') as f:
                   json.dump({'last_processed': start_idx + batch_size}, f)
       ```

  2. **Enhanced Logging**
     * Detailed logging of each step
     * Status tracking for each batch
     * Ability to resume from last successful batch
     * Implementation:
       ```python
       def enhanced_logging(batch_number: int, status: str, details: dict):
           log_entry = {
               'timestamp': datetime.now().isoformat(),
               'batch': batch_number,
               'status': status,
               'details': details
           }
           logger.info(f"Batch {batch_number}: {status}")
           save_to_log_file(log_entry)
       ```

  3. **Recovery Strategy**
     * Automatic identification of last successful point
     * Ability to resume from any checkpoint
     * Verification of data integrity at restart
     * Example:
       ```python
       def resume_processing():
           last_successful = find_last_successful_batch()
           verify_data_integrity(last_successful)
           return start_from_checkpoint(last_successful)
       ```

- **Learning from the Incident**:
  1. **System Design**
     * Importance of planning for failures from the start
     * Importance of incremental data processing
     * Value of robust recovery mechanisms

  2. **Data Persistence**
     * Regular saving of state
     * Importance of recovery points
     * Balance between performance and security

  3. **Monitoring and Logging**
     * Detailed logging of progress
     * Real-time monitoring
     * Ability to track and debug problems

- **Best Practices for Crash Safety**:
  * Implement checkpoints from the start
  * Design for recovery, not just normal operation
  * Thorough logging and monitoring
  * Regular backup of critical data
  * Automated recovery routines
  * Testing of recovery scenarios

- **Positive Effects**:
  * More robust system after improvements
  * Faster recovery from problems
  * Better overview of process status
  * Increased reliability in production environment

### 2.7 Core Functionality and Database Architecture

#### 2.7.1 Database Structure and Design
I implemented a robust and scalable database architecture with the following components:

##### SQLAlchemy Integration
```python
class DatabaseConnection:
    _instance = None
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.engine = create_engine(
            DATABASE_URL,
            poolclass=QueuePool,
            pool_size=5,
            max_overflow=10,
            pool_timeout=30,
            pool_recycle=1800
        )
        self.Session = sessionmaker(bind=self.engine)
        
    @classmethod
    def get_instance(cls):
        if cls._instance is None:
            cls._instance = DatabaseConnection()
        return cls._instance
```

    # Validate postal code
    postal_code = address.get('postal_code', '')
    if not re.match(r'^\d{5}$', postal_code):
        errors.append(f"Invalid postal code format: {postal_code}")
    
    # Validate city against municipality list
    city = address.get('city', '')
    if city not in self._load_swedish_cities():
        errors.append(f"Invalid city: {city}")
    
    return errors
```

    errors = []
    
    # Basic validation
    errors.extend(self._validate_amount(transaction))
    errors.extend(self._validate_currency(transaction))
    errors.extend(self._validate_accounts(transaction))
    
    # Business rule validation
    errors.extend(self._validate_transaction_type(transaction))
    errors.extend(self._validate_frequency(transaction))
    
    # International validation

        self._validate_customer_data(customer_data)
        return self._create_customer_in_db(customer_data)
        
    def get_customer(self, personnummer: str) -> Customer:
        """Gets customer with validation"""
        self._validate_personnummer(personnummer)

        db1 = DatabaseConnection.get_instance()
        db2 = DatabaseConnection.get_instance()
        self.assertIs(db1, db2)
    
    def test_connection_retry(self):
        """Tests reconnection on failure"""
        with self.assertRaises(SQLAlchemyError):
            self.db.engine.connect()
        time.sleep(1)
        self.assertTrue(self.db.engine.connect())
