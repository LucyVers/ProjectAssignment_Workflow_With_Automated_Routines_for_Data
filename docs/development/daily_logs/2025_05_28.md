## Afternoon Session (Database Setup)
### Completed Tasks
1. Database Setup
   - Created new PostgreSQL database named 'bank_db'
   - Configured database connection settings
   - Verified database exists and is accessible

2. Environment Configuration

3. Testing the updated import structure
4. Setting up the database

### Model Files Import Summary
All model files have been updated to use the new import structure:
```python

# New imports
from database.db import Db
from models.account import Account
```

Next files to update:
1. Utility files:

## Evening Session (Utility Files Analysis)
### Discoveries and Decisions
1. Original Utility Files Analysis
   - Found three utility files in original project:
     - `interest.py`: Basic interest rate handling
     - `manager.py`: Loan approval functionality
     - `officer.py`: Account and credit approval
   - All files were skeleton implementations
   - Only contained basic class definitions and TODOs

2. Enhancement Decisions
   - Decided to expand utility files with proper structure
   - Added comprehensive documentation
   - Defined clear class responsibilities
   - Set up type hints for better code quality

3. Specific Improvements
   - Interest Class:
     - Added interest rate configuration (2% savings, 5% loans)
     - Prepared for different account types
     - Set up framework for interest calculations
   
   - Manager Class:
     - Defined approval limits (1M loans, 100k credit)
     - Added loan approval framework
     - Prepared credit limit management
   
   - Officer Class:
     - Set transaction limits (50k credit, 100k daily)
     - Added account approval structure
     - Prepared customer verification system

4. Future Implementation Plans
   - Interest calculations need actual implementation
   - Loan approval logic to be developed
   - Account verification system to be implemented
   - Need to add audit logging for all operations

### Next Steps
1. Database Schema Review
   - Compare create_db.sql with current schema
   - Plan necessary migrations
   - Document any required changes

2. Implementation Priorities
   - Decide which utility to implement first
   - Set up testing framework for utilities
   - Plan integration with existing models

### Technical Notes
- All utility files now have proper type hints
- Documentation follows Python docstring standards
- Prepared for future unit testing
- Set clear boundaries for different roles

# Development Log - May 28, 2025

## Late Evening Session (Starter Project Integration Review)
### Current Situation Analysis
1. Starter Project Status
   - I have partially integrated files from python-bank-project-start (https://github.com/WeeHorse/python-bank-project-start)
   - Files currently in my project:
     - src/models/account.py
     - src/models/bank.py
     - src/models/customer.py
     - src/models/transaction.py
     - src/database/db.py

2. What I've Done So Far
   - Organized files into a better structure (models/ and database/ directories)
   - Updated import statements to match new structure
   - Created comprehensive documentation structure
   - Set up database connection and testing

### Action Plan Forward
1. Documentation Phase (Current)
   - [x] Document current project state
   - [ ] Create detailed comparison checklist

   - Added indexes for frequent queries
   - Optimized transaction monitoring
   - Improved audit log performance

4. Security Improvements
   - Added approval tracking

   - Added transaction monitoring

### Next Steps
1. Database Migration
   - Test new schema
   - Create rollback plan
   - Document migration process

2. Implementation Tasks
   - Update models to use new tables
   - Implement audit logging
   - Add monitoring functionality

### Technical Details

## Next Steps
1. Complete the starter project integration plan
2. Proceed with systematic analysis
