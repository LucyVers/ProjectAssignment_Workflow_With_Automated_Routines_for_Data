# Daily Log - June 4, 2024

## Project Structure and File Overview

### Active Files and Their Roles

1. **Database Models** (`src/models/database_models.py`):
   - Defines all data models (Bank, Customer, Account, Transaction)
   - Contains important validation constraints:
     * Account number: `^SE8902[A-Z]{4}\d{14}$`
     * Personal ID number: `^\d{6}-\d{4}$`
     * Postal code: `^\d{5}$`
     * Phone: `^\+46\s*\(\d{1,4}\)\s*\d{3}\s*\d{2}\s*\d{2}$`
   - Handles sessions and database connections with SQLAlchemy

2. **Main Validation** (`src/data_processing/data_validator.py`):
   - Our primary validation class
   - Integrates with the database through SQLAlchemy models
   - Handles validation of:
     * Personal ID numbers
     * Addresses
     * Phone numbers
     * Account numbers (according to database model format)

3. **Workflow System** (`src/data_processing/workflow.py`):
   - Implements Prefect for workflow management
   - Coordinates the entire data validation process
   - Links validation with database operations

4. **Data Analysis** (`src/data_processing/customer_data_analyzer.py`):
   - Performs in-depth analysis of customer data
   - Identifies patterns and potential issues
   - Analyzes relationships between customers and accounts

5. **Development Environment** (`notebooks/data_quality_validation.ipynb`):
   - Jupyter notebook for interactive testing
   - Visualization of validation results
   - Used for development and debugging

### Today's Implementations

### 1. Great Expectations Validation
Successfully implemented and tested Great Expectations validation for:
- Amount validation (between 0.01 and 100,000)
- Currency validation (SEK, EUR, USD, etc.)
- All validations passed successfully

### 2. Workflow Automation Implementation Status
Verified that our Prefect workflow implementation in `workflow.py` includes:

#### 2.1 Prefect Tasks and Flows
- `load_data`: Loads transaction and customer data from CSV files
- `validate_transactions`: Validates all transactions
- `validate_customers`: Validates customer data
- `export_to_database`: Exports valid data to database
- `generate_report`: Creates validation reports

#### 2.2 Automatic Reporting
- Logging of validation results for each transaction
- Statistics for valid/invalid transactions
- Summary reports with key metrics

#### 2.3 Error Handling and Logging
- Uses Python's logging module for consistent logging
- Automatic rollback on database errors
- Detailed error reporting for debugging

### 3. Enhanced Data Validation System
I have significantly improved our data validation system by implementing comprehensive validation for:

#### 3.1 Guardian Information for Minors (`src/data_processing/data_validator.py`)
- Added validation for customers under 18 years
- Checks for presence and format of guardian information
- Validates guardian's personal ID number
- Reports missing or invalid guardian information

#### 3.2 Address Validation (`src/data_processing/data_validator.py`)
- Implemented dual validation system for Swedish and international addresses
- Swedish addresses:
  * Strict format validation (street, postal code, city)
  * 5-digit postal code requirement
  * City presence verification
- International addresses:
  * Flexible postal code validation based on country
  * Basic format requirements
  * Country-specific validations
- Added statistics tracking for address types

#### 3.3 Phone Number Standardization (`src/data_processing/data_validator.py`)
- Implemented standardization to format: `+46 (0)XXX XXX XX XX`
- Handles multiple input formats:
  * International format (+46...)
  * 00-format (0046...)
  * National format (0XX...)
  * Raw numbers
- Added comprehensive validation and error reporting
- Includes format statistics and standardization results

### 4. Code Organization and Cleanup
- Removed redundant validator (`src/utils/validators.py`)
- Consolidated validation logic in `data_validator.py`
- Improved error reporting and logging

### 5. Modified Files
1. `src/data_processing/data_validator.py`:
   - Added guardian validation
   - Enhanced address validation
   - Implemented phone standardization
   - [Link to changes](src/data_processing/data_validator.py)

2. `src/utils/validators.py`:
   - Removed as functionality was merged into data_validator.py
   - Prevented confusion with duplicate validation logic

### 6. Next Steps
1. Test workflow with larger datasets
2. Fine-tune logging and reporting as needed
3. Document any performance issues

### Notes
- All validations working as expected
- Workflow system fully implemented
- Logging and error handling in place
