# Daily Log - June 4, 2025: Transaction Validation Implementation

## Today's Achievements

### 1. Transaction Validation System
- Created comprehensive `TransactionValidator` class in `src/data_processing/transaction_validator.py`
- Implemented validation rules from `validation_rules.md`
- Added support for:
  * Amount validation (min/max limits)
  * Currency validation
  * Account number format validation
  * Transaction type validation
  * International transfer validation
  * Frequency validation

### 2. Workflow Integration
- Updated `workflow.py` to use new `TransactionValidator`
- Improved logging and reporting
- Streamlined database export process
- Added detailed error tracking

### 3. Testing Implementation
- Added transaction validation tests to `notebooks/data_quality_validation.ipynb`
- Created test cases for:
  * Valid transactions
  * Invalid amounts
  * Invalid currencies
  * International transfers
  * Account format validation

### 4. Great Expectations Validation Results
- Successfully implemented and ran Great Expectations validation suite
- Achieved 100% success rate across all validations:
  * Amount validation: All 100,000 transactions within limits (0.01-100,000.0 SEK)
  * Currency validation: All transactions use approved currencies
  * Transaction type validation: All transactions correctly marked as "incoming" or "outgoing"
  * Timestamp validation: All entries have valid timestamps in correct format
- No missing or invalid data found in critical fields
- Validation statistics:
  * Total expectations evaluated: 5
  * Successful expectations: 5
  * Success rate: 100%

## Files Modified
1. `src/data_processing/transaction_validator.py` (new)
   - Main transaction validation implementation
   - Business rules and limits
   - Error handling and reporting

2. `src/data_processing/workflow.py`

   - Real data testing support
   - Implemented Great Expectations validation suite

## Next Steps
1. Add more comprehensive transaction frequency validation
2. Implement transaction pattern analysis
3. Add support for recurring transaction detection
4. Enhance international transfer validation
5. Add additional Great Expectations validations:
