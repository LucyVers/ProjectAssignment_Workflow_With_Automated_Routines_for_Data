## Recommendations for Tomorrow (May 31, 2025)

### Morning Priority: Identity Data Issues
1. **Duplicate Personnummer Analysis**
   - Start with extracting the complete list of 419 duplicates
   - Group duplicates by pattern (exact duplicates vs variations)
   - Assess impact on account relationships
   - Prepare risk mitigation strategies

2. **Age Verification Investigation**
   - Review the 55 potentially underage accounts
   - Create age distribution analysis
   - Check against account opening dates
   - Prepare compliance recommendations

### Afternoon Focus: Address and Contact Data
1. **Address Validation**
   - Compare invalid postal codes against official database
   - Map geographic distribution of issues
   - Identify patterns in city name discrepancies
   - Create standardization proposal

2. **Phone Number Standardization**
   - Analyze patterns in non-standard numbers
   - Create format conversion rules
   - Design validation process
   - Prepare implementation plan

### Key Documents to Reference Tomorrow
- Customer Data Analysis (for detailed findings)
- Validation Rules (for compliance requirements)
- Data Quality Strategy (for implementation approach)

### Tools Ready for Use
- Data validation script (already tested)
- Customer data analysis framework
- Documentation templates

Remember: Focus on duplicate personnummer issue first as it presents the highest regulatory and security risk.
