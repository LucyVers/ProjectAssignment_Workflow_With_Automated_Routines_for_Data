# Daily Log - June 3, 2025

## Morning Session Progress (10:00-11:30)

### Completed Tasks
1. **Jupyter Notebook Setup and Initial Analysis**
   - Successfully loaded and verified data:
     * transactions.csv (100,000 records)
     * sebank_customers_with_accounts.csv (1,000 records)
   
2. **Data Visualization Implementation**
   - Created three key visualizations:
     * Transaction Amount Distribution (histogram)
     * Transaction Types Distribution (pie chart showing 50.2% incoming, 49.8% outgoing)
     * Bank Account Types Distribution (bar chart)
   
3. **Initial Data Analysis**
   - Transaction Amount Statistics:
     * Mean: 23,712.39 kr
     * Std Dev: 15,052.98 kr
     * Min: 5.26 kr
     * Max: 49,999.22 kr
   - Transaction Type Distribution:
     * Incoming: 50,199 (50.2%)
     * Outgoing: 49,801 (49.8%)

## Afternoon Session Progress (11:30-14:00)

### Data Validation Results

1. **Missing Data Issues**
   - Geographic data missing for 500 transactions:
     * sender_country and municipality
     * receiver_country and municipality
   - Notes/comments missing for 9,948 transactions
   - All critical fields (ID, amount, accounts) are complete

2. **Account Validation Issues (Critical)**
   - All 1,000 customer accounts failed basic validation
   - 90,000 transaction accounts not found in customer database
   - Indicates potential structural issue with account number format

3. **Transaction Quality**
   - No duplicate transactions found
   - All transaction types are valid (incoming/outgoing)

4. **Geographic Distribution**
   - Sweden dominates transactions:
     * 80,306 transactions from Sweden
     * 75,755 transactions to Sweden
   - Other top countries: Norway, Denmark, Germany, Estonia

### Next Steps

1. **Priority: Account Number Investigation**
   - Analyze current account number format in both databases
   - Determine correct format specification
   - Develop new validation rules
   - Plan for data cleaning/transformation

2. **Geographic Data Investigation**
   - Investigate 500 transactions with missing location data
   - Determine if pattern exists in these transactions
   - Develop completion strategy if possible

3. **Documentation Updates**
   - Document all found data quality issues
   - Create action plan for each issue
   - Update validation routines based on findings

### Notes
- Account number validation is highest priority due to 100% failure rate
- Geographic data completeness is secondary priority
- Transaction type validation shows good data quality in that aspect

## Remaining Implementation Plan

### Afternoon Session (13:00-17:00)

1. **Database Integration (13:00-14:00)**
   - [ ] Implement transaction handling
   - [ ] Set up data export functions

2. **Workflow Automation (14:00-15:00)**
   - [ ] Create Prefect flow
   - [ ] Implement validation and loading

3. **Testing (15:00-16:00)**
   - [ ] Test with full dataset
   - [ ] Verify rollback functionality
   - [ ] Test complete workflow

4. **Documentation (16:00-17:00)**
   - [ ] Update README.md
   - [ ] Update implementation plan
   - [ ] Prepare for tomorrow's tasks

## Notes and Observations
- Data quality appears good with balanced transaction types
- Transaction amounts follow expected distribution
- No missing values detected in initial analysis
- Successfully fixed visualization issues with correct column names

## Next Steps
1. Complete data validation implementation
2. Set up database integration
3. Implement automated workflow
4. Create comprehensive testing suite
