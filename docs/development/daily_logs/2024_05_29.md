## Today's Work

### Morning Session (Database Work)
#### Database Configuration Progress
- Basic project structure in place
- PostgreSQL database created (bank_db)
- Database connection module implemented (src/database/db.py)
- Initial schema files created:
  - initial_schema.sql
  - V2__add_utility_support.sql

#### Database Tasks Completed
- [x] Reviewed current database implementation
- [x] Analyzed migration requirements
- [x] Planned migration strategy

### Late Morning Session (Data Quality Analysis)
#### Missing Country Analysis
- Analyzed transaction data across all years (2022-2026)
- Discovered 2024 as quality benchmark year
- Identified error rates per year:
  - 2022: 1.43% (4/279)
  - 2023: 0.67% (4/599)
  - 2024: 0% (0/129) - Perfect data quality
  - 2025: 0.49% (489/98811)
  - 2026: 1.56% (3/192)

#### 2024 Validation Pattern Analysis
- Documented complete validation rules
- Analyzed transaction characteristics
- Identified key quality checks:
  - Mandatory field validation
  - Geographic data verification
  - Character encoding standards
  - Currency validation rules

### Afternoon Session (Documentation Work)
#### Documentation Updates
1. **Analysis Documentation**
   - Created detailed analysis in missing_country_analysis.md
   - Added system configuration analysis
   - Documented validation patterns and recommendations

2. **Project Documentation Review**
   - Reviewed existing documentation structure
   - Identified documentation overlap and duplication
   - Created work_plan.md for better overview

3. **TODO List Cleanup**
   - Removed duplicate entries
   - Consolidated data quality tasks
   - Updated task status based on recent analysis
   - Improved structure and traceability

### Technical Findings
#### Data Quality Insights
- Identified systematic validation improvements in 2024
- Found consistent error patterns across other years
- Documented specific validation rules for implementation

#### Database Configuration Status
- Connection parameters configured
- Basic schema structure in place
- Migration framework selected (Alembic)

## Decisions and Insights
1. **Database Approach**
   - Will use Alembic for migrations
   - Need to implement proper logging
   - Plan for transaction rollback mechanism

2. **Data Quality Approach**
   - Using 2024 as quality benchmark
   - Will implement 2024 validation patterns
   - Need to analyze customer data next

3. **Documentation Strategy**
   - Maintaining comprehensive daily logs
   - Using work_plan.md as quick reference
   - Keeping TODO.md as master task list

## Next Steps
1. **Database Implementation**
   - Finalize database schema
   - Set up Alembic migrations
   - Implement test connections

2. **Data Analysis**
   - Begin analysis of sebank_customers_with_accounts.csv
   - Document relationships between CSV files
   - Update analysis documentation

3. **Implementation Planning**
   - Design validation framework based on 2024 patterns
   - Plan automated quality checks
   - Prepare monitoring system design

## Questions and Considerations
- Need to understand relationship between transactions and customer accounts
- Consider how to implement 2024 validation rules across all years
- Plan for handling international transactions and character encoding
- Need to ensure all database operations are properly logged
- Consider implementing transaction rollback mechanism
- Plan for handling approximately 1 million transactions per day

## Notes
- Database and data quality work are proceeding in parallel
- Documentation structure is now better organized
- Need to maintain balance between different work streams

## Plan for Tomorrow (2024-05-30)
### First Priority Task
- Complete thorough analysis of sebank_customers_with_accounts.csv
  - Review customer data structure and patterns
  - Analyze relationships between customers and accounts
  - Document validation requirements
  - Prepare for validation framework implementation
  - Build on today's initial findings

Note: This analysis was started today but intentionally postponed to ensure proper focus and thorough review when fresh.
