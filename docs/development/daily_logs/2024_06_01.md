# Daily Log - June 1, 2025

## Critical Project Insight
**Important Development Principle**: 
We must prioritize enhancing existing scripts from the starter project rather than creating new ones. This means:
1. Always check existing scripts before creating new ones
2. Understand current functionality before making changes
3. Build upon and improve existing code structure
4. Adapt existing scripts to meet our requirements

This approach:
- Maintains consistent project structure
- Reduces code duplication
- Leverages existing tested foundations
- Follows the intended purpose of using a starter project

## Project Requirements Analysis and Prioritization

### Core Requirements (Must Implement First)
1. **Data Quality Monitoring**
   - ❌ Automated Validation System
     * Required by project: "tillämpa datakvalitets-strategier och verktyg för att minimera risker och fel"
     * Purpose: Identify and reject/correct invalid transactions
     * Implementation needed in notebook format
   
   - ❌ Reporting System
     * Required by project: "Generera en rapport i er notebook"
     * Purpose: Track and document data quality issues
     * Must be implemented in Jupyter notebook format

2. **Current Progress on Core Requirements**
   - ✅ Basic database structure
   - ✅ Transaction handling with rollbacks
   - ✅ Migration system
   - ✅ Basic validation framework

### Nice-to-Have Features (Implement After Core Requirements)
These features would enhance the system but are not explicit project requirements:

1. **Logging Enhancements**
   - Log rotation
   - Environment-specific log levels
   - Detailed transaction logging

2. **Advanced Testing**
   - Stress testing
   - Performance metrics

3. **Advanced Transaction Features**
   - Savepoints
   - Complex transaction management

4. **Enhanced Monitoring**
   - Dashboard
   - Alert system

### Implementation Priority
1. First Priority: Core Requirements
   - Create Jupyter notebook for data validation
   - Implement automated validation system
   - Set up reporting system in notebook

2. Second Priority (If Time Permits)
   - Implement nice-to-have features
   - Enhance system robustness
   - Add advanced monitoring capabilities

### Project Structure Analysis
After careful review of the project structure, we have identified the following components:

#### 1. Original Scripts from Starter Project
1. **Core Models**:
   - `db.py` - Basic database connection using psycopg2
   - `bank.py` - Basic bank operations
   - `account.py` - Account management
   - `customer.py` - Customer management
   - `transaction.py` - Transaction handling
   - `test_connection.py` - Basic database connection testing script

2. **Utility Scripts (Skeletons to be Enhanced)**:
   - `interest.py` - Interest calculations skeleton
   - `manager.py` - Bank manager functions skeleton
   - `officer.py` - Bank officer functions skeleton

#### 2. Our Enhanced Implementation
- `database_models.py` - Advanced SQLAlchemy models with:
  * Data validation
  * Table relationships
  * Quality constraints
  * Migration support
  * Security features

#### 3. Migrations Structure Issue
We discovered two separate migrations directories:
1. `/migrations/` (root):
   - Alembic migrations for SQLAlchemy
   - Python-based migrations
   - Handles our new database structure

2. `/src/database/migrations/`:
   - SQL migrations from starter project
   - Plain SQL files

**Decision**: We will temporarily maintain both migration directories while we complete our review and consolidation process.

### Today's Implementation Plan

#### 1. Morning Session (09:00-12:00)
### Planned Tasks
1. Duplicate Personnummer Analysis
   - [ ] Generate complete list of 419 duplicate cases
   - [ ] Analyze duplication patterns
   - [ ] Develop remediation proposals
   - [ ] Document associated risks and impacts

2. Age Verification Review
   - [ ] Analyze 55 cases of potentially underage customers
   - [ ] Categorize by age groups
   - [ ] Assess regulatory compliance risks
   - [ ] Develop verification process proposal

#### 2. Afternoon Session (13:00-17:00)
### Planned Tasks
1. Address Validation Analysis
   - [ ] Analyze 998 invalid postal codes
   - [ ] Investigate 886 invalid cities
   - [ ] Compare against official postal database
   - [ ] Document geographic patterns

2. Phone Number Standardization
   - [ ] Categorize 459 non-standardized numbers
   - [ ] Create standardization rules
   - [ ] Test standardization process
   - [ ] Document special cases

## Implementation Progress

### 1. Morning Session (09:00-10:00) - Session Factory Implementation
✅ Enhanced database_models.py with:
1. **Session Factory Pattern**
   - Implemented SessionFactory and ScopedSession
   - Added context manager (session_scope) for safe transaction handling
   - Configured automatic commit/rollback handling

2. **Connection Pooling**
   - Implemented QueuePool for connection management
   - Configured pool parameters:
     * pool_size: 5 (base connections)
     * max_overflow: 10 (additional connections)
     * pool_timeout: 30 seconds
     * pool_recycle: 1800 seconds (30 minutes)

3. **Error Handling**
   - Added retry_on_error decorator for automatic retries
   - Implemented exponential backoff for retries
   - Added comprehensive error logging

4. **Environment Configuration**
   - Added dotenv integration
   - Configured database connection via environment variables
   - Set up default development values

## Module Structure Analysis

### Analysis of __init__.py Files
We have identified and documented the purpose of the project's three critical __init__.py files:

1. `src/__init__.py`:
```python
"""
This module contains the core functionality of the data quality validation system.
"""
```
- **Purpose**: Main module for the entire project
- **Function**: Makes the entire src directory a Python module
- **Role**: Defines the project's overall scope and functionality

2. `src/database/__init__.py`:
```python
"""
Database testing and connection management utilities.
"""
```
- **Purpose**: Module for database testing and connection management
- **Function**: Makes the database directory a Python module
- **Role**: Collects testing tools and utilities for database management

3. `src/models/__init__.py`:
```python
"""
Database models and connection management.
"""

from .database_models import session_scope, Bank, engine, retry_on_error

__all__ = ['session_scope', 'Bank', 'engine', 'retry_on_error']
```
- **Purpose**: Module for database models and ORM
- **Function**: 
  * Makes the models directory a Python module
  * Imports and exposes key components from database_models.py
- **Role**: Central for database interaction and model management

## Test Implementation Progress (14:00-15:00)

### Database Connection Testing Improvements
We have successfully enhanced and fixed the database connection testing framework:

1. **Retry Mechanism Enhancement**
   - Updated retry decorator in `src/models/database_models.py`:
     * Changed from handling only `OperationalError` to all `SQLAlchemyError`s
     * Improved error logging and retry messaging

2. **Test Script Improvements** in `src/database/test_connection.py`:
   - Enhanced retry mechanism test:
     * Added proper attempt counting
     * Improved test logging
     * Implemented progressive failure simulation
   - Added delay parameter for faster testing

3. **Test Results**
   All tests now pass successfully:
   - ✅ Basic Connection Test
   - ✅ Connection Pooling Test
   - ✅ Retry Mechanism Test
   - ✅ Transaction Management Test

### Next Steps
1. **Further Testing**
   - Add more edge cases
   - Implement stress testing
   - Add performance metrics

2. **Documentation**
   - Update API documentation
   - Add test coverage reports
   - Document test patterns

3. **Integration**
   - Integrate with CI/CD pipeline
   - Add automated test reporting
   - Implement monitoring
