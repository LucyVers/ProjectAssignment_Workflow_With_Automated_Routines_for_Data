## Today's Focus
Implementation of database import system for the banking system, focusing on customers, accounts, and transactions.

## Current Status Overview
✅ COMPLETED: Customer data import (all unique customers from CSV)
⏳ IN PROGRESS: Account import setup
❌ NOT STARTED: Transaction import

## Achieved Milestones

### 1. Database Structure and Bank Setup
- Verified database structure for all tables (banks, customers, accounts, transactions)
- Created and added main bank to database:
  * Name: "Huvudbanken"
  * Bank number: "SE8902"
  * Script: [`add_bank.py`](../../../add_bank.py)

### 2. Customer Import Status - COMPLETED ✅
- Successfully imported ALL unique customers from CSV:
  * Total rows in CSV: 1000 (includes multiple accounts per customer)
  * Unique customers identified and imported: 581 (based on personnummer)
  * Each customer has ~1.72 accounts on average (1000/581)
  * All customers are now in the database
  * No more customer imports needed - this task is COMPLETE

### 3. Created Utility Scripts
1. [`add_bank.py`](../../../add_bank.py)
   - Purpose: Add the main bank to database
   - Functionality: Creates a bank with name and bank number

2. [`check_banks.py`](../../../check_banks.py)
   - Purpose: Verify bank data in database
   - Functionality: Shows all banks and their information

3. [`check_db.py`](../../../check_db.py)
   - Purpose: Monitor database content
   - Functionality: Shows count of customers, accounts, and transactions

### 4. Data Analysis Results
- Customer data analysis (COMPLETED):
  * All 581 unique customers successfully imported
  * Each customer has a unique phone number
  * Phone numbers formatted to standard: "+46(XX)XXX XX XX"
  * All customers linked to main bank (bank_id = 1)
- Account data analysis (PENDING):
  * 1000 total accounts in CSV need to be imported
  * Multiple accounts per customer exist in original data
  * Each account will need a unique account number

### 5. Technical Improvements
- Updated `prepare_account_data` function to:
  * Include bank_id
  * Handle personnummer for customer mapping
  * Generate unique account numbers in format SE8902[A-Z]{4}\d{14}

## Problems and Solutions
1. **Problem**: KeyError 'account_number' during import
   - **Solution**: Updated code to use personnummer instead of account_number for customer mapping

2. **Problem**: Phone number formatting
   - **Solution**: Implemented formatting to handle both local and international formats

## Next Steps (In Priority Order)
1. Import ALL Accounts (NEXT IMMEDIATE TASK)
   - Import all 1000 accounts from CSV
   - Each account must be linked to its correct customer
   - Ensure each customer gets all their accounts from the CSV
   - Verify account numbers follow format SE8902[A-Z]{4}\d{14}

2. Implement Transaction Import (AFTER ACCOUNTS ARE DONE)
   - Link transactions to correct accounts
   - Validate transaction data

3. Quality Control
   - Verify customer-account relationships
   - Check all data formatting

## Observations
- Guardian_info is set to NULL for all customers - may need updates for minors
- Phone number formatting works well but some numbers may be NULL
- Batch-processing with size=10 works efficiently for large data sets

## Useful Commands
```bash
# Check database content
python check_db.py

# Add bank
python add_bank.py

# Run import with batch size 10
python -c "from src.data_processing.workflow import validate_and_load; validate_and_load(batch_size=10)"
```

## Import Status Summary
- ✅ Banks: 1/1 completed
- ✅ Customers: 581/581 completed (all unique customers from CSV)
- ⏳ Accounts: 0/1000 pending (NEXT TASK)
- ❌ Transactions: 0/? not started

## Data Relationships Clarification
- One customer can have multiple accounts
- In our CSV:
  * 581 unique customers
  * 1000 total accounts
  * Example: If a customer has 2 accounts, they appear in 2 rows with the same personnummer but different account numbers
