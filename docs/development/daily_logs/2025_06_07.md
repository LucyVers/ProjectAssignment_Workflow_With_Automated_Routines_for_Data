## Today's Focus
Implementation of database import system for the banking system, focusing on customers, accounts, and transactions.

## Current Status Overview
✅ COMPLETED: Customer data import (all unique customers from CSV)
✅ COMPLETED: Account import setup and execution
❌ NOT STARTED: Transaction import

## Achieved Milestones

### 1. Database Structure and Bank Setup
- Verified database structure for all tables (banks, customers, accounts, transactions)
- Created and added main bank to database:
  * Name: "Huvudbanken"
  * Bank number: "SE8902"
  * Script: [`add_bank.py`](../../../add_bank.py)

### 2. Customer Import Status - COMPLETED ✅
- Successfully imported ALL unique customers from CSV:
  * Total rows in CSV: 1000 (includes multiple accounts per customer)
  * Unique customers identified and imported: 581 (based on personnummer)
  * Each customer has ~1.72 accounts on average (1000/581)
  * All customers are now in the database
  * No more customer imports needed - this task is COMPLETE

### 3. Account Import Status - COMPLETED ✅
- Successfully imported ALL accounts from CSV:
  * Total accounts in CSV: 1000
  * All accounts successfully validated and imported
  * Each account correctly linked to its customer
  * All account numbers follow format SE8902[A-Z]{4}\d{14}
  * All accounts set to type 'checking' (default)
  * Each account linked to main bank (bank_id = 1)

### 4. Created/Modified Scripts
1. [`src/data_processing/workflow.py`](../../../src/data_processing/workflow.py)
   - Modified to handle account imports
   - Key functions:
     * `prepare_account_data()`: Prepares account data for import
     * `export_accounts_to_database()`: Handles the actual database import
     * `import_accounts()`: Main workflow for account import

2. [`import_accounts.py`](../../../import_accounts.py)
   - Purpose: Execute account import workflow
   - Functionality: Reads CSV, validates and imports accounts

3. [`add_bank.py`](../../../add_bank.py)
   - Purpose: Add the main bank to database
   - Functionality: Creates a bank with name and bank number

4. [`check_banks.py`](../../../check_banks.py)
   - Purpose: Verify bank data in database
   - Functionality: Shows all banks and their information

5. [`check_db.py`](../../../check_db.py)
   - Purpose: Monitor database content
   - Functionality: Shows count of customers, accounts, and transactions

### 5. Data Analysis Results
- Customer data analysis (COMPLETED):
  * All 581 unique customers successfully imported
  * Each customer has a unique phone number
  * Phone numbers formatted to standard: "+46(XX)XXX XX XX"
  * All customers linked to main bank (bank_id = 1)
- Account data analysis (COMPLETED):
  * All 1000 accounts successfully imported to database
  * Multiple accounts per customer verified and linked
  * All account numbers follow format SE8902[A-Z]{4}\d{14}
  * Each account properly linked to its customer

### 6. Technical Improvements
- Updated `prepare_account_data` function to:
  * Include bank_id
  * Handle personnummer for customer mapping
  * Generate unique account numbers in format SE8902[A-Z]{4}\d{14}

- Created new functions for account import:
  * `export_accounts_to_database`: Specifically for account import
  * `import_accounts`: Streamlined workflow for accounts
  * Modified `load_data` to handle optional paths

## Problems and Solutions
1. **Problem**: KeyError 'account_number' during import
   - **Solution**: Updated code to use personnummer instead of account_number for customer mapping

2. **Problem**: Phone number formatting
   - **Solution**: Implemented formatting to handle both local and international formats

3. **Problem**: Empty transaction path causing error
   - **Solution**: Modified `load_data` function to handle optional paths

4. **Problem**: Duplicate customer import attempts
   - **Solution**: Created separate workflow for account import that skips customer reimport

## Next Steps (In Priority Order)
1. Implement Transaction Import (NEXT IMMEDIATE TASK)
   - Link transactions to correct accounts
   - Validate transaction data
   - Ensure proper date/time handling
   - Verify transaction amounts and types

2. Quality Control
   - Verify customer-account relationships
   - Check all data formatting

## Observations
- Guardian_info is set to NULL for all customers - may need updates for minors
- Phone number formatting works well but some numbers may be NULL
- Batch-processing with size=10 works efficiently for large data sets

## Useful Commands
```bash
# Check database content
python check_db.py

# Add bank
python add_bank.py

# Run import with batch size 10
python -c "from src.data_processing.workflow import validate_and_load; validate_and_load(batch_size=10)"
```

## Import Status Summary
- ✅ Banks: 1/1 completed
- ✅ Customers: 581/581 completed (all unique customers from CSV)
- ✅ Accounts: 1000/1000 completed (all accounts imported and linked)
- ❌ Transactions: 0/? not started

## Data Relationships Clarification
- One customer can have multiple accounts
- In our CSV:
  * 581 unique customers
  * 1000 total accounts
  * Example: If a customer has 2 accounts, they appear in 2 rows with the same personnummer but different account numbers
