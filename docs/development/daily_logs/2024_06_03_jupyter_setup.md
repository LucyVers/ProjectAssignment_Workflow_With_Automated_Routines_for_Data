# 2025-06-02: Jupyter Notebook Setup and Initial Testing

## Achievements
1. Successfully set up Jupyter Notebook environment
   - Created new notebook `data_quality_validation.ipynb`
   - Configured necessary Python packages (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, great_expectations)

2. Data Loading Implementation
   - Successfully loaded both data files:
     - transactions.csv (100,000 records)
     - sebank_customers_with_accounts.csv (1,000 records)
   - Verified correct file paths and data access

3. Initial Data Visualization
   - Created basic visualizations:
     - Transaction amount distribution
     - Transaction type distribution (50.2% incoming, 49.8% outgoing)
     - Bank account type analysis
   - Confirmed data visualization capabilities working

4. Data Quality Checks
   - Verified bank account format consistency
   - All 1,000 accounts follow expected format (SE8902 + 4 letters + 14 digits)
   - Successfully loaded and displayed basic statistics

## Next Steps
Implementation of full requirements as planned:
- Complete data validation system
- Customer data validation
- Data processing and standardization
- Database export functionality
- Comprehensive reporting system

## Technical Notes
- Working directory structure confirmed functional
- File paths correctly configured (`../data/working/` from notebooks directory)
- Visualization libraries (matplotlib, seaborn) properly configured
- Great Expectations framework ready for implementation
