# Daily Log - May 31, 2024

## Status Update
Today's work focused on two main areas:
1. Completing the customer data analysis
2. Implementing the database structure with migrations

## Previous Day Summary (May 30, 2024)
Yesterday's key achievements:

1. Documentation and Structure:

   - Integrated KYC requirements with transaction validation rules
   - Created comprehensive cross-document references
   - Set up organized data directory structure
   Related docs: 
   - [Validation Rules](../analysis/data_quality/validation_rules.md)
   - [Data Directory Structure](../../data/README.md)

2. Customer Data Analysis Initial Findings:
   - Analyzed all 1000 customer records
   - Identified critical data quality issues:
     * 419 duplicate personnummer cases
     * 55 potentially underage customers
     * 998 invalid postal codes
     * 886 invalid city names
     * 459 non-standardized phone numbers

## Today's Achievements

### 1. Database Structure Implementation
1. **Initial Database Setup**
   - Created initial database migration with tables:
     - customers
     - accounts
     - transactions
   - Implemented data quality constraints for:
     - Personnummer format
     - Phone number format
     - Postal code format
     - Account number format

2. **Critical Fix: Added Bank Table**
   - Discovered missing bank table from starter project
   - Added bank table with:
     - Basic bank information (name, banknr)
     - Relationships to customers and accounts
   - Updated existing tables with bank relationships
   - Created and applied additional migration

3. **Migration Status**
   - First migration: `17d43b382de8_initial_database_structure.py`
   - Second migration: `aa1c006394e2_add_bank_table_and_relationships.py`
   - Both migrations successfully applied to database
   - All migrations are reversible if needed
   - Database structure now matches complete system requirements

4. **End of Day Database Verification**
   - Verified that database exists and is accessible
   - Confirmed all migrations are applied (current version: aa1c006394e2)
   - Validated environment variable configuration
   - Updated alembic.ini to use environment variables
   - Modified migrations/env.py to properly handle environment variables

### 2. Customer Data Analysis Progress
09:00 - Started daily planning and log review
09:15 - Updated daily log with yesterday's progress
09:30 - Added documentation cross-references and created analysis document templates
10:00 - Completed analysis of duplicate personnummer:
        - Identified 27 high-risk cases (4+ accounts)
        - Found 2 customers with 6 accounts each
        - Documented findings and recommendations
        See: [Duplicate IDs Analysis](../analysis/data_quality/duplicate_ids_analysis.md)
10:30 - Completed age verification analysis:
        - Analyzed 55 underage cases
        - Identified 17 accounts missing guardian info
        - Created risk assessment and action plan
        See: [Age Verification Analysis](../analysis/data_quality/age_verification_analysis.md)
11:00 - Completed address validation analysis:
        - Analyzed 1000 addresses
        - Found case standardization issues in all city names
        - Mapped geographic distribution across regions
        See: [Address Validation Analysis](../analysis/data_quality/address_validation_analysis.md)
11:30 - Completed phone number standardization analysis:
        - Analyzed 1000 phone numbers
        - Found 498 non-standard formats
        - Created standardization and validation rules
        See: [Phone Number Analysis](../analysis/data_quality/phone_number_analysis.md)

## Issues and Challenges
1. System Control Gap:
   - Current system allows customers to exceed account limit policy
   - No automated warning system for multiple accounts
   - Need for enhanced monitoring system

2. Age Verification Concerns:
   - Missing guardian information for 17 underage accounts
   - Non-standardized age verification process
   - Lack of age-appropriate account controls

3. Address Quality Issues:
   - Inconsistent city name formatting
   - Uneven geographic distribution
   - Missing address validation process

4. Phone Number Standardization:
   - Nearly 50% non-standard formats
   - Multiple digit length patterns
   - Missing validation process

## Tomorrow's Tasks (June 1, 2024)
1. Database Implementation:
   - Test database structure:
     * Create test bank
     * Add test customers
     * Verify relationships and constraints
   - Set up data validation with Great Expectations
   - Implement ETL processes
   - Configure Prefect workflows

2. Implementation Planning for Data Quality Issues:
   - Account limit controls
   - Warning system for multiple accounts
   - Enhanced monitoring system
   - Age-appropriate account restrictions
   - Guardian verification process
   - Address standardization rules
   - Phone number standardization
   - Automated validation processes
